The Bee
A 4th-Year University Game Development Assignment

The Bee is a 3D rogue-lite flight simulator that explores the life of a honey bee through physics-based gameplay. Players must balance risk vs. reward by managing flight stamina (nectar) and inventory weight (pollen) while navigating a semi-procedural meadow environment.

Key Features
Physics-Based Flight Controller: Custom Rigidbody controller with drag, angular damping, and hover mechanics.

Dynamic Weight System: Collecting pollen increases mass, dynamically altering flight handling and speed (simulating real bee physics).

Resource Management Loop: A "Rogue-lite" core loop where players must balance gathering resources against a draining stamina bar before returning to the hive.

Immersive Audio: Features procedural engine sounds (pitch-shifting based on velocity) and 3D spatial audio for landmarks.

Universal Render Pipeline (URP): Utilizes custom shaders for wind-affected vegetation and macro-style depth of field.

 Tech Stack
Engine: Unity 2022/6 (URP)

Language: C#

Tools: VS Code, ProBuilder

Option 3: The "Casual/Gamer" Style
Best if you want it to sound like a game store page.

The Bee
Survive the Meadow. Fill the Hive.

Take flight as a tiny bee in a massive world. The Bee is a relaxing yet strategic flying game where you explore a lush, dangerous meadow.

Fly Fast, Carry Heavy: The more pollen you collect, the slower you fly. Do you push your luck for a high score, or return home safe?

Manage Your Fuel: Nectar is your stamina. Run out, and you're grounded.

Macro World: Experience the world from a bug's eye view with immersive depth-of-field visuals and spatial sound.

Recommendation: I suggest using Option 2 for your assignment submission. It clearly lists the "Technical Features" (Physics, Audio, Systems) which helps the marker see exactly what you achieved at a glance.
